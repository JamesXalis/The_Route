# The_Route

## Description

### **This repository includes all files of The Route**

The Route is designed to help users organize their their activities throughout the day. For ease-of-use, time blocks are automatically color coded to represent if it's corresponding time of day has already passed, is upcoming, or the present time of day. Moreover, any entries for a timeblock's input field will persist through refresh and closure of application once it's save button is clicked.

### Developing the Application



### Future Development of this Application

One feature that will be added in a future update is automatic deletion of previous day entries.
